Steven is having a meeting Friday at 1 o'clock with company to discuss CMS options. Steven wants Assurant to stay with DNN as he likes it, so he will need to convince the board to stay. 

Having a meeting with him and Tony S 5/24/2017 

5/24/2017 TL 

Per our meeting with Steven Lee, he stated that Assurant is planning to phase off DNN for business reasons. 

The reasons discussed were: 

80% of their sites are on SiteFinity, the company wanted to move to one CMS and have already signed a contract with SiteFinity. 
They have 20+ certified SiteFinity developers while they had one person that helped managed DNN tasks. 
The numbers that they’ve received from SiteFinity was significantly lower than what was given from DNN. 

Even though Steven likes the product, the decision has been made by their new CIO. Per our understanding, they have 2 licenses, one coming up for renewal next month and another in 2018 ($100K) ... latter is up for churn risk.</td>

Demo schedule with Chris by Billy and his Director on May 3rd at 12pm. 
Agenda: 
Hey Tony & Chris, 
I am really excited to get some more in-depth details on EVOQ 9.1. These are the items I would be most interested in: 

1. Any Intranet features/enhancements. We are beginning a project to create our Intranet and working with DNNPro (Mark Harle), but want to use as much of the out of the box functionality of EVOQ 9.1 as possible. I am specifically interested in the items below, but also anything you think would be helpful in our Intranet project. 
a. Governance 
b. Document Management 
c. Integration - MS Project? 
d. Active Directory SSO - We are currently using AD-PRO, is this now available out of the box? 
e. SSO to both the user's “home (campus)” portal and the district portal 

2. Will forms/content items/visualizers realistically allow non-programmers to develop “apps”? For Example: Special school application process for students 
a. more interested in how work with the data after the form is created. 
b. Create a form to collect student applications - don’t need to spend time building a form 
c. Control which students are able to submit the form 
d. Create a management view to work with the collected data 
i. Update data - Accept, decline, waitlist type functionality 
ii. Create aggregate information about the data 

3. API’s both in EVOQ and connecting securely to API’s on premise. 
a. Security features/connection mechanisms. 
b. Any examples I can look at 
c. Can a form be set to post to an on premise API securely? 

4. Liquid Content 
a. I see how this would be great for a businesses that post a lot of content to multiple channels. I am having a hard time seeing it being of great benefit to us. 

5. Breaking changes 9.1 
6. Other notable roadmap items 


Sincerely, 

William (Billy) Shelton 

May 3rd 2017 TS 
Demo executed by Chris with Billy and his team. They're looking to upgrade in near future and will reach out to Chris directly for outstanding items. Their concern is slow Sandbox device which potentially could be due to their SQL code, Bruce will take a closer look at that.

Demo completed with Robert by Chad. Robert noted, they're not using Evoq Engage features and don't find it that beneficial YET. They've built custom modules for everything, AD being example as they didn't want to buy one from store. He like FB, LC and API features, near future he will see look closely at those and try to import data from custom modules in LC through API. They're on 8.4.2 and will be upgrading to 9.1.1 soon. Also, provided email address for support, they'll be reaching out with assistance to upgrading.

Customer was worried about the Security issue (resolved) and is not ready to upgrade or demo -MF 

April 24th 2017 TS 
Per Elizabeth, they are already using Evoq 8, however would like to learn more about new features in 9.1, breaking changes and roadmap items. I’m also including Betsy and Tom in this invite as they are actively working on Support ticket (8596). 
Meeting scheduled for Wednesday at 1pm with Chad with Elizabeth, Tom, Betsy and Jaime. 

April 27th 2017 TS 
Jaime wants to schedule a follow-up call to look closely at Evoq Engage, Liquid Content, other Evoq customers using Community (Engage) and Jaime will provide list of tools / recommendations of what’s missing in Evoq today that would help Boundless with engagement (their community users). Currently, they have 4,000 community Users and only "1 to 2" stick around. Some of it is they are still uploading resoureces, some is they are still learning to use Evoq. 

Jaime will provide recommendations that can help them improve Evoq and increase engagement. Call setup for May 10th at 2pm. 

Jaime also noted, they are willing to upgrade from 8.4.1 when Evoq 9.1 Cloud package is ready. 

---------------------- 
I wanted to send this list over to your team ahead of our call today. Currently, this is a high-level list of our pain points with our DNN implementation. I'm looking forward to reviewing them in more detail during our call. 

1.  Marketo Integration is not working 
o affecting our current version 
2.  Password Reset Email is resulting in an Error 
o `The redirect_uri parameter is not valid: "https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/UserLogin/ctl/Login/success/true?returnurl=/?email=bemmons@mapstory.org&message=You can now login to the application with the new password." If url looks fine, check that you are not including non printable chars` 
o Users cannot change their password when manually sent a password reset email from Auth0 
3.  User Roles aren’t Expiring 
o If an expiration date is set for a role within DNN, the role is ported to Auth0, however the expiration date is not. Therefore, we need to manually remove user roles from Auth0. 
o This is true for roles set by a community manager in DNN and for roles set via the subscription provider Chargify 
4.  Zendesk Integration is Quirky 
o When a ticket is submitted from Connect, it remains in the “pending” status rather than moving back to “open” when a customer responds 
5.  Is there an automated way to bulk assign roles? 
o Is writing a SQL statement the only way to bulk assign roles? 
6.  Bugs with writing CSS into the WYSIWYG 
o DNN will create extra spans and HTML out of nowhere 
7.  Site is very slow when updating pages (designs, text, security changes) 
8.  Padding errors throughout the site 
o “Like” text overlaying buttons and question text 
9.  HotJar Integration was a pain to install 
o DNN broke three times trying to get the integration to work 
o Stopped reading CSS during install (lost its template) 
10. Switching between Community manager and Production host is excruciating 
o changing the security roles for a page requires two logins 
11. DNN cannot read SVG files 
o workaround is to upload .png files 
12. Wish layout was more flexible so we had more options to change the look of certain pages (Desktop Learning Center)* 
13. Sandbox Configuration is Unknown 
o How do we setup a sandbox environment so we can prep and test changes 

May 10th 2017 TS 
Some of these are bugs that are fixed in 9.1, they will upgrade and see whatever is outstanding. Others were addressed in the meeting with Chad and myself. For 5, they want to look at custom module and get number of hours it would take from Pro Services team.Undo

July 6th 2017 TS 
Demo scheduled with Troy on July 12th at 8am. 

July 12 2017 MG 
Demo completed with Troy Dotson. Their current set up has over 50 public facing portals and over 150 portals on their intranet. 3 years ago they consolidated the portals with the assistance of a DNN Partner and have not made any big change after that. 
Regarding 9.1, he liked Analytics and mentioned that was important for the company; nevertheless, he mentioned "cloud aversion" being present on their company which might stop them from moving to the use of MicroServices.

June 14th 2017 TS .. notes from discovery call with Mike Atkins 
- INTO Global (privately funded) has University partnerships, 10 year old company headquartered in UK. 
- 1700 users .. 50 million in turnover 
- With university partnerships, they go into ventures .. 21 diff joint ventures .. 1 in china .. rest are split across U.S. and U.K. 
- They market universities as destinations for students to attend school 
- Example, if you're born in China ..you want western degree.. they'll arrange that.. put student in touch with school 
- They have physical buildings on campuses for registration .. students can spend anywhere from 3 months to 3 years and they split the cost (profits) with universities 

- How they find students? Two ways 

intostudy.com .. website .. search for course see your option and student goes from there.. university partner will make the offer 
b2b site.. intoglobal.com .. 8% of revenue comes from agency... agents are all over, ex; in shopping mall 

- Both sites powered by DNN. Built and maintained by Cantarus, Mike says they will very strongly be growing in Digital field. Mike is looking at growing his internal team and working with Cantarus. 
- They have slightly outdated version (8) of DNN, wants to upgrade to 9. 
- DNN doesn't have a good name with his organization .. as the website was been built by external suppliers, pre Cantarus. 
- Mike's internal customer is marketing team.. their websites are available in four languages; English, Chinese, Russian, Arabic 
- Content editing is frustrating for their DNN users. 
- Site pages take long-time to load 
- Most of their production inventory is in Salesforce .. they want to export this data .. much more live API read in DNN 
- Looking for more improved search 
- Between those two sites .. they want to share common assets .. in total they have 22 university sites around the world

Goals: 
Reduce friction of maintaining site 
Better experience for staff who works with DNN .. also customers 

- Looking for guidance on how DNN can help in the meeting and how DNN can help sell this internally 

- Internally Mike's client is VP of Marketing .. she was pressuring Mike on a/b testing .. they're aiming to be very data-driven .. her example of a/b testing, add new features and 
run old and new versions in parallel and get feedback 

Audience for call .. product owners rather than website.. VP of Marketing .. CTO Andy 

Mike is trying to present upgrade (path) .. let us not get distracted .. "we going to upgrade and these are the great feature." 
- Mike is under pressure to deliver new sites and features. Mike needs our help to make this happen. 
Check off hygiene issues.. A/B testing, share content across sites .. excite people with potential.. stuff they can do and they didn't even thought of doing 

- Meeting will be scheduled on June 29th at 8.30 am. Mike will be back in office on 28th. 

- Provided support email so they can log tickets if need being. 

Aug 28 2017 TS 
Haven't heard back from Mike on Evoq 9 demo after multiple attempts, info passed on to Alex ... for reachout.

Thanks Tony. We're about to re-up some licenses so this week is good if we can discuss. 

I'd like to see how the tool has grown for the collaboration features (if any). We would not be able to upgrade until a certificate of networthiness was done anyway.

Per my discussion with Chris and Jason, Jason has already seen a demo and provided his feedback and concerns regarding Evoq 9 Engage. For last 2 months, he's been utilizing Evoq 9 trial. 

NOTE: Jason is not interested in Engage unless it is updated to allow for people to comment or reply with a file attachment. This is a very big point.

Called and left voicemail for Manuel Neri 

April 10-17 
Manuel opened ticket. 

May 1-17 
Completed Demo with Manuel (Chad was the presenter). We went over how Liquid Content can filter by tags to show certain content. This opens up possibilities such as filtering by language tags to handle translation. 

Manuel also mentioned that he jas been using DNN for several years now and seems to be quite comfortable with it. It took a while to get used to the Persona Bar when moving away from the Control Bar, but other than that, it seems like Evoq has been getting more convenient/easy to use.

Had a demo with Yelena. This is the summary: 
Currently on Evoq Content 8.2 
Very concerned about DNN's security (Regular security updates) 
CMS is now only heavily on marketing purposes only 
Two portals that existed one for marketing and one for customers to upload personal information (Moved away from CMS for the latter) 
Website is now solely for marketing team (Post content update changes) 
Custom modules that allowed customers to connect to the database and display information to user. Goes through two process security where they can input credit card information and personal information (Trying to move away from that) 
Major module they use HTMLPro 
Showed her Analytics, Liquid Content and Form Builder as she was mainly interested in those features. Interested in all of Evoq 9's new features. 
I will be sending her how to upgrade from 8.2 to 9.1 as she will be looking to upgrade to utilize the new features. 

They have a lot of different CMS', we want them to sole use Evoq. Possible upsell
